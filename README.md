# ANEMONE-LEACHATE

This repo organizes files and code for the single-stressor *Anthopleura elegantissima* leachate ecotoxicology exposure conducted by Sarah Tanja and Kip Howell in Spring Quarter, 2024 at the JPG Lab Aquatic Facility (Portage Bay Building). 

In this experiment, we exposed an n=5 *Anthopleura elegantissima*, commonly known as the aggregating or pink-tipped anemones, to either 5 increasing concentrations (0.01mg/L, 0.1mg/L, 1mg/L, 10mg/L, 100mg/L) of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or photodegredated polypropylene (PP) for 48 hours.

After the exposure, we compared the resulting dark-adapted rapid light curves and rates of respirometry and photosynthesis of the treatment groups to the controls. 

In summary:
- We found no differences in rapid light-curve parameters between the controls and treatments after 42 hours of exposure. 
-  Our respirometry and photosynthesis rates measurements were inconclusive, the duration of our respirometry runs (30mins) were insufficiently long to capture the low metabolic and photosynthetic rates of *A. elegantissima*, and we recommend longer respirometry runs (24hours) for future studies.

This pilot experiment gave us an introduction to:
- using a co-developed microplastic leachate protocol in ecotoxicological assays
- working with the temperate coastal *A. elegantissima* anemones as an emerging model
- the analysis of dark-adapted rapid light curves
